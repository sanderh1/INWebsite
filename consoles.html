<h1 style="font-family:verdana;">The history of consoles</h1>
<p style="font-family:verdana;">The first video game consoles were created in the 70's, with consoles such as the<br>Magnavox Oddysey and Coleco Telstar. These were all part of the first generation<br>of consoles. These consoles served as an inspiration for the first succesful arcade<br>game, Pong.</p>
